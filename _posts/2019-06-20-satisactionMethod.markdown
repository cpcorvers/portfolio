description: According to Weick (1995), any map or strategic plan will work when an organisation is lost, because it will give an orientation for people to follow. Once on the move the cues along the path will guide the way. This brought me to the research topic:<br>"Once people begin to act, they generate tangible outcomes in some context and this helps them discover what is occurring, what needs to be explained and what should be done next" (Weick, 1995 p. 55).<br><br>This text describes the intended meaning of the Satis-action method through which participants start acting together and generate tangible outcomes and a tangible context of the specific case or project they are working in. By doing so, they discover the ongoing situation (awareness), start explaining their professional interpretation of the problem and the actions they can undertake, to each other (understanding) and thereby identify possible next steps to come to a comprehensive solution.<br><br>Satis-action with the accompanied System Constellation Play XL tool was re-designed to do empirical research on the method with the use of the qualitative research methodology intuitive inquiry. This inquiry is executed in two different environments of collaborating organisations during worksessions with the involved professionals.<br><br>The System Constellation Play XL is a communication tool to make the central figures and characters tangible and sensible. The tool uses large artefacts like pawns of a board game to visualize the central figures, characters and satisfiers. <br><br><img src="img/portfolio/satisaction-design-thumbnail.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">Satis-action uses a story-theater discourse as an understandable process for the participants who will structure the environment around the central figure with the use of the System Constellation Play XL and start an interactive dialogue on the dynamics in the system. These activities are referred to as the Play –like the collection of scenes in a theater–. The guided Play has four acts.<br>1- Introduction of the central figure<br>2- Setup of the constellation<br>3- Dialogue<br>4- Closing act.<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/satisaction-research-workshop-visual.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">The Play is guided by a moderator and recorded with video and/or picture cameras. From these records important snapshot are visualized on an abstract overview. Besides this storyline, the outcome of the Play are a common picture on the problem case and a prioritized set of actions or interventions for the participants.<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/satisaction-researchslide.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><h3>Findings</h3><p>When professionals setup the scenery and performing in a dialogue, they generate the awareness and activities within the system constellation and this helps them to discover what is the situation of the central figure, what are the dynamics around the central figure, what needs to be explained to other characters and what should be done to improve the need of the central figure in a sustainable manner.<br><br><a href="https://www.devakmakerij.nl" target="_blank">De Vakmakerij</a> provide workshops and training of Satis-action as a service which is all ready used in different conferences and real-life problem cases.

During the M1.2 project research on the Satis-action methodology was executed with the following question. <br>How does Satis-action improve the collaboration between organisations working in a specific case on wicked problems?
Central figures are visualized by a person-artefact. Characters are designed in six predefined forms and satisfiers are visualized by coins.
