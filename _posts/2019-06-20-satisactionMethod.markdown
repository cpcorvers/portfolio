description: During the M1.1 Design project Satis-action was created as an interaction method which endeavors the environment and dynamics of people, communities and organisations around a specific case, preferably a human being. The satis-action method is designed on wicked problems of specific cases in complex environments. It tries to achieve a more balanced and sustainable environment. With the satis-action method professionals are looking for fulfillment of needs of the central figure within its environment (Max-Neef, Antonio & Martin, 1992).<br><br>In the M1.2 Research project emperical research on this methodology was executed with the following question. How does Satis-action improve the collaboration between organisations working in a specific case on wicked problems?<br><br>The System Constellation Play XL is a communication tool to make the central figures and characters tangible and sensible. The tool uses large artefacts like pawns of a board game (figure 1) to visualise the central figures, characters and satisfiers. Central figures are visualised by a person-artefact. Characters are designed in six predifined forms an distinguished by color (see figure 2). Satisfiers are visualised by coins and are visually linked to a character by color (see figure 3).<br><br>Satis-action uses a story-theater discours to create an understandable language for the participants. The participants structure the system constellation with the use of the System Constellation Play XL and start a dialogue on the dynamics in the system constellation. These activities are referred to as the Play which exist out of four acts,<br>1- introduction central figure<br>2- Setup the constellation<br>3- Dialogue<br>4- Closing act.<br><br>Satis-action with the accompanied System Constellation Play XL tool was designed to do empirical research on the method in practice with the use of the quantitative research methodology intuitive inquiry. <br><br> <a href="https://www.devakmakerij.nl" target="_blank">De Vakmakerij</a> provide workshops and training of Satis-action as a service which is all ready used in different conferences and real-life problem cases.
