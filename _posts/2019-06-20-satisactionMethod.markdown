description: During the M1.1 Design project the Satis-action methodology was created, during the M1.2 Research project empirical research on this methodology was executed with the following question. <br><br>How does Satis-action improve the collaboration between organisations working in a specific case on wicked problems?<br><br>Satis-action with the accompanied System Constellation Play XL tool was re-designed to do empirical research on the method in practice with the use of the qualitative research methodology intuitive inquiry. This inquiry is executed in two different environments of collaborating organisations during worksessions with the involved professionals.<br><br>The System Constellation Play XL is a communication tool to make the central figures and characters tangible and sensible. The tool uses large artefacts like pawns of a board game to visualize the central figures, characters and satisfiers. Central figures are visualized by a person-artefact. Characters are designed in six predefined forms an distinguished by color. Satisfiers are visualized by coins and are visually linked to a character by color.<img src="img/portfolio/satisaction-research-workshop-visual.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">Satis-action uses a story-theater discours to create an understandable language for the participants who will structure the system constellation with the use of the System Constellation Play XL and start a dialogue on the dynamics in the system constellation. These activities are referred to as the Play which exist out of four acts,<br>1- Introduction of the central figure<br>2- Setup of the constellation<br>3- Dialogue<br>4- Closing act.<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/satisaction-researchslide.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br><a href="https://www.devakmakerij.nl" target="_blank">De Vakmakerij</a> provide workshops and training of Satis-action as a service which is all ready used in different conferences and real-life problem cases.
