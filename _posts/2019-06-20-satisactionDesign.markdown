description: This design project started with the objective to create a method and tools to improve and understand the interaction within the transformation paradigm (Brand and Rocchi 2011) and transformative practices (Hummels, Trotto, LeÃÅvy, Peeters, Lino Alves & Klooster, 2018). <br><br>Studying literature, professionals, practitioners and designing tools we learned how to initiate the interaction within complex issues in society. Workshop in the Designhuis with professionals learned that tangible tools really make a difference in the conversations on these issues.The artefacts and embodiment of stakeholders created a common understanding by participants during workshops. This was a conversation kick-starter because observations showed participants very quickly started talking about the content instead of the context and the participants really listened to each other; they became more sensitive towards each other and the topic. Through these insights the method Satis-action was created.<br><br>Satis-action is an interaction method which endeavors the environment and dynamics of people, communities and organisations around a specific case, preferably a human being. The satis-action method is designed on wicked problems of specific cases in complex organisational environments. It tries to achieve a more balanced and sustainable environment.<br><br>The satis-action Play:<br>Central figures represent the problems or needs of the specific case at hand. The central figures are set in the middle of the attention. The persons, groups, communities or organisations in the environment of the central figures are called characters. The characters are represented by professionals. The last representation is the satisfier. Satisfiers are contributions by characters to solve the issues of the central figure. Satisfiers come in all kind of forms like products, services, capital, information or social engagements (Ekins & Max-Neef, 1992). With the satis-action method professionals are looking for fulfillment of needs of the central figure within its environment (Max-Neef, Antonio & Martin, 1992).<br><br> <a href="https://www.devakmakerij.nl" target="_blank">De Vakmakerij</a> provide workshops and training of Satis-action as a service which is all ready used in different conferences and real-life problem cases.
