description: This design project started with the objective to create a method and tools to improve and understand the interaction within the transformation paradigm (Brand and Rocchi 2011) and transformative practices (Hummels, Trotto, LeÃÅvy, Peeters, Lino Alves & Klooster, 2018). <br><br>Literature study, conversations with professionals and practitioners and experimenting with designed tools in workshops created insights and inspiration to support the interaction of professionals working on complex issues in society. <br><br>Tangible tools really make a difference in the conversations on these issues. The artefacts and embodiment of stakeholders created a common understanding by participants during workshops. Participants very quickly started talking about the content instead of the context, they became more sensitive towards each other and the topic. Through these insights the method Satis-action was created.<br><br>Satis-action is an interaction method which endeavors the environment and dynamics of people, communities and organisations in a specific case around a human being. It tries to achieve a more balanced and sustainable environment.<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/satisaction-design-thumbnail.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><h3>The Satis-action Play:</h3><p>Central figures represent the individual with a problem or need of the specific case at hand. The central figures are set in the middle of the attention. The persons, groups, communities or organisations in the environment of the central figures are called characters. The characters are represented by professionals (not on the pictures for privacy and security reasons). The last representation is the satisfier which are contributions by a character to solve the issues of the central figure. Satisfiers come in all kind of forms like products, services, capital, information or social engagements (Ekins & Max-Neef, 1992). <br><br>With the satis-action method professionals are looking for fulfillment of needs of the central figure within its environment (Max-Neef, Antonio & Martin, 1992).<br><br> <a href="https://www.devakmakerij.nl" target="_blank">De Vakmakerij</a> provide workshops and training of Satis-action as a service which is all ready used in different conferences and real-life problem cases.
