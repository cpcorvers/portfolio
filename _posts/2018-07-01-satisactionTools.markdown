description: Satis~action is a method developed to create insights into value creation within the Transformative Paradigm and designed with a research through design approach during the M1.1 master design project.

The method combines Sustainability Development, Human Scale Development methodology and System Dynamics group model building.
For the user-assessment of the method, two tools have been developed, a board game for the 3rd person perspective and a person-institution setup for the 1st person perspective.

Satis~action focuses on improving the needs of a specific person. These needs are met by satisfiers which come about with the help of characters. The connection between characters visualizes the satisfiers. In this way a tangible world is constructed around the specific person.

The chain of satisfiers visualizes a value-flow with which the participants determine the satisfaction-values for the different characters. Comparing these values creates an image about the resilience and sustainability in the constructed world of the specific person.
