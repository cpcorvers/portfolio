          <body> The wellfare state of our modern society is impresive, we live in prosperity. But our way of living comes with a cost. We pollute our oceans, poles, rainforrest and air. Our commodities are created by people living in embarrising
            circumstances or even slavery. The in- dividualisation in our society
            create exclusion of people. The cost of our modernisation becomes sensible at the bottum of the global society and is paid by other people and nature.
            <br><br>
            A multi-disciplinairy collaboriation can make a change from this dark side of modernisation to a more sustainable development (United Nations, 2007). A way to facilitate this transformation is described in the transformative practices
            (Hummels, Trotto, LeÃÅvy, Peeters, Alves Lino & Klooster, 2018). A society moving towards the transformation paradigm requires a fundamental shift in mindset, vocabulary and behaviour (Gardien, Djajadiningrat, Hummels & Brombachter,
            2014).
            <br><br>
            Governments and their organisations have to adapt to the continuous change of society. Change in public sector organisations is a complex process. Designers can contribute to these transformation pratices with their methods and tools.
            I want to become this type of designer.

            Spiritual development and a meaningful life is a growing need of individuals. Organisations address or incorporate these kind of spiritual needs1 with the use of a valuable and meaningful interaction between individuals and organisations
            within a collebora- tive ecosystem. Leaders can realise a meaningfull ecosystem by learning the practices of designers and moral consultant. I want to become this kind of leader.
