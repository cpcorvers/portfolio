              Craftsmenship is all about the dedicated and engaged professional who masters tools and techniques for the sake of the work on its own (Sennet, 2008).
              This portfolio-layout is crafted along the qualities to give a glance of my intended craftmenship. The expertise areas of the study are interwoven as well.

              I aim to seduce individuals and organisations towards a morally right transformation and empower them with techniques and tools to take into account individual and organisational rights, duties, interest and wishes in order to satisfy
              the needs of all involved others (Ekins & Max-Neef, 1996; Governance and Integrity, 2008).
